## Description
The goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that displayed the current date and allowed users to enter tasks and/or events for the hours between 9AM and 5PM. Hours of the day would be color-coded based on whether they were in the past, present, or future, and events recorded by the user were added to (and retrieved from) local storage.

## Installation
This application is publicly available online, so there are no installation instructions necessary. 

## Usage
The planner should be used to record daily tasks and events. 

## Testing
Users should verify that the current day and date display at the top of the application. Hours of the day should be color-coded based on whether they are in the past, present, are future. Additionally, users should be able to enter text to record a task/event for a given time block and then save that entry. After refreshing the application, the previously entered text should still display.
